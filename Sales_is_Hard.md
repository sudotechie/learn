I've discovered a few great resources on sales recently. 

The first comes in the form of a Field Guide from the venture capital firm, Unusual Ventures. I was fortunate to join Omnition, one of Unusual's first investments. At the time, they were in the early stages of building their brand and reputation as a team that helps founders early on in their journey (sometimes pre-first line of code) navigate all the challenges of building a company and getting to product-market-fit. 

The second is a new book called *The Qualified Sales Leader*, written by John McMahon, a legend in sales that has been credited with building out the MEDDIC sales methodology. The MEDDIC process has been instrumental in helping sales productivity scale predictably by establishing a common language and qualification process used to understand likelihood of an opportunity closing. 

And to be honest, there are countless other resources that can help anyone become a better sales person or leader. 

So what's preventing every founder from becoming a great sales person? I mean, we've already discussed the inherit advantages a founder has in selling their product. 

There are a number of things a founder can do to increase success in sales. You can study the steps and stages. You can memorize the stories. You can write down and practice the questions. 

The problem is that it all takes time and reflection. I remember my first sales calls while selling a market-leading web conferencing solution called WebEx. Yes, it's still around. At the time I was selling it, we had ~70% market share. I was on a call, going through the "discovery process" interrogating a prospect until they gave me something I could quantify, so I could build a business justification that would remove any doubt from a subsequent purchase. The prospect got angry. I extracted as much value as I could from the convesation, because I needed to "check those boxes". 

To make matters worse, at the time, the best sales reps could perform a "one-call close" and that was the gold standard for great selling. Little did I know that many of those "one-call" closes were actually prospects further along in the buying process, but I digress...

The hardest part of selling is not the preparation for the call. Anyone can do that. It's being creating forward momentum on a call while also being present. Presence is defined as being able to process what the prospect is saying and adjusting, without  It's about knowing when to go deeper or wider. It's about building champions, consisting of trust and shared beliefs. Without these nuances, and the ability to create these relationships within very limited time windows, it's truly difficult to make anything big happen. Most first-time founders I've worked with fall into the trap that either they don't have a process, or they accept interest in the product (or in solving the problem) as confirmation of buying intent. Then they stop, and either ask for the deal or wait for it to happen naturally. Both produce anxiety.

On the flipside, smaller, more transactional business with a product-led growth strategy (ie see-try-buy) should not require this level of sales execution. And in all honesty, I've been here before and would really rethink your business if you have this model and don't have a path to either the deal sizes that make it worthwhile, or the belief that the product will get to a point where there is less friction or more immediately recognized value.
