Product-led growth (PLG) is everywhere, and now it&#39;s entered enterprise B2B.

VCs are pressing their investments to have a strategy for it.

Marketers are being asked to put together a &quot;PLG-specific&quot; marketing strategy.

Sales is wondering is asking, &quot;what&#39;s going to happen to our jobs?&quot;

Product Management is confused, saying &quot;I think we&#39;re already doing that.&quot;

Docs is like, &quot;wait, so we get more resources?&quot;

The &quot;problem&quot; is that there are great success stories to cite - Github, Atlassian, Stripe, etc. All share tales of lower CPL, sales-related COGS, viral growth, industry-leading NPS. (Let&#39;s ignore how their sales motions evolved over time)

And you&#39;re only a Google search away from amazing content. [Exhibit A](https://www.field-guide.unusual.vc/field-guide-enterprise/introduction-to-plg-product-led-growth) [Exhibit B](https://www.amazon.com/Product-Led-Growth-Build-Product-Itself-ebook/dp/B07P6288ZF) [Exhibit C](https://podcast.openviewpartners.com/public/32/OV-%7C-BUILD-21cbd466/f02990c2) and so on.

Back when I started selling, a prospect couldn&#39;t even download a datasheet without putting in their contact information. The majority of all sales were outbound, and any product-specific docs or forums were behind a login-required support forum.

Fortunately, that changed. Stats started to come out indicating that buyers were much further along in their decision-making process by the time marketing and sales actually got to talk to them. This was problematic. How could marketing better influence the process, if conversations weren&#39;t even happening?

Buyers were fed up with having to go through the sales process. And many target users naturally opted out. Desk phones became optional, and non-existent for developers. Open source software trained developers to expect self-service consumption of information and software. Communities like Stackoverflow and Hacker News, along with product comparison sites like G2 Crowd emerged to allow users to collect intel prior to contacting a vendor. Hubspot built a business by educating marketers that survival required content. The only effective _and_ sustainable method to add value and generate pipeline was through a combination of product and industry/persona content. Investing in an inbound strategy, and going to where your customers were, would be rewarded through lower costs per lead, and, ideally, greater than linear growth.

Then came &quot;conversational marketing&quot;. I&#39;m personally not really sure if it is really a thing, or just a symptom of a broken, not-agile-enough content-creation process and frictionless access to humans. Or maybe it&#39;s an important part of the overall pre-sales engagement strategy. Regardless, the goal was to provide just-in-time access for those that needed it most, specifically when they were in the act of educating themselves on a company&#39;s products or services.

Surprisingly, these three worlds are all still alive and well, living together in a symbiotic relationship. You&#39;ve got your gated content and events, living alongside ungated content consumed via many channels, and a way to engage directly with a bot or live human, nearly 24/7.

So where are the gaps in the presales process? Let&#39;s ignore the early funnel activities of actually landing a prospect on your site.

For enterprise SaaS, chances are that you&#39;re also catering to multiple stakeholders. Developers, responsible for integrations and/or implementations will want access to technical docs, typically beyond the scope for marketing slicks and blog announcements. These same users will probably want to access the tool prior to engaging with a human. They&#39;ve seen the marketing, now it&#39;s time for the proof. Does the product do what it says it will do? Better yet, does it get me to a wow moment? Others call this time-to-value, _Aha_ moments...it&#39;s all related.

Product-led growth is about more than just getting prospects into the product. It&#39;s about identifying the friction points that prevent your prospects and existing customers from experiencing value.

I believe PLG is the successful implementation of a UX-centric culture. If everything a company does serves to drive _customer_ outcomes at various points within a user&#39;s journey, then chances are, they have implemented a successful PLG strategy. Within the product, it&#39;s about creating experiences that promote greater engagement, both for individual users and across stakeholders. Examples include the discovery of additional product value or in automatically generated content that users _want_ to share with colleagues.

I almost said, the end goal is to...but the truth of the matter is, that there is no end goal in PLG. As the product changes and evolves and users within companies come and go, the experience that a user feels and the value of each interaction must remain. In this infinite game, there are ways to measure how you&#39;re doing. Most notably, close rates, sales cycles, and upsells (more commonly measured as dollar-based net revenue retention or net revenue retention). There will be correlated metrics as well, examples include lead attribution, support case numbers, product usage, feature engagement. A16Z talks about more complexity aka knobs doesn&#39;t necessarily help with PLG, but is a necessity for enterprise-selling. I still think advanced features can be introduced while still delivering a great UX, but probably depends on case-by-case basis (ie do I need admin permissions to do this?).

So the question remains, who owns PLG? Personally, I think everyone at a company does.

In SaaS, the sales process never ends. And PLG makes sure that everyone knows their role in making the sale.

Whether it&#39;s Marketing and Docs working closely together to develop the streams of content that various user types will consume.

Or if it&#39;s Sales working with the &quot;owners&quot; of the problem (and usually, the budget) to understand the value the solution can deliver across an entire organization, leveraging user metrics and adoption plays.

Or Product making sure that users can evaluate the product in a friction-free way, getting to those wow moments as quickly as possible, all while promoting content sharing opportunities, and creating no dead-ends of ambiguity or confusion within the product.

Or enabling Renewals to supply consumable data to the right stakeholders to demonstrate the value delivered during the term, to take existing use-cases to the next level and identify new ones.

Or Support being accessible and responsive, sharing and promoting available documentation with customers and constantly delivering feedback to internal teams.

PLG is not a one-time fix, and it isn&#39;t owned by a single team. It&#39;s an ongoing investment in culture and company alignment.
